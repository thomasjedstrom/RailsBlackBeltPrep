# Rails Black Belt Prep Assignment

Using Rails, this is an app with a lot of CRUD.  Users can login/register, pages include authentication.  Users can create and manage events, join others' events, and post comments on events.  I used the built in gems for authentication however I just discovered devise and will be modifying this app to use it in the near future.
